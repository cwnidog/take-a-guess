      Function playGame() plays a guessing game where the user is asked to enter
      information about a safety razor: who made it, what it was called, and what kind
      of finish it has.

      The user interface is provided by a web browser. When a commit button on the
      browser screen is clicked, an integer, answerNum, is passed to the function indicating whichquestion is being answered. The function then reads the
      appropriate text box toget the player's answer. If the answer is incorrect, a hint is displayed. If it is correct, the word "Correct" is displayed.
      *******************************************************************************/

            var guess = ""; // player's guess

            // use the answerNum to locate the correct text box for this answer and

            // consistent form for checking.
