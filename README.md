take-a-guess
============

The take-a-guess project plays a guessing game with a player.

The user interface is provided by a web browser. When a commit button on the
browser screen is clicked, an integer, answerNum, which indicates which
question is being answered is passed to the function
playGame(). The function then reads the appropriate text box toget the player's answer. If the answer is incorrect, a hint is displayed. If it is correct, the word "Correct" is displayed.

The HTML has been validated by the W3C validator, whichalso checks ARIA
