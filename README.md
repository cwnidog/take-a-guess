============

Function playGame() plays a guessing game where the user is asked to enter
information about a safety razor: who made it, what it was called, and what kind
of finish it has.

The user interface is provided by a web browser. When a commit button on the
browser screen is clicked, an integer, answerNum, is passed to the function indicating whichquestion is being answered. The function then reads the
appropriate text box toget the player's answer. If the answer is incorrect, a
hint is displayed. If it is correct, the word "Correct" is displayed.

The HTML has been validated by the W3C validator, whichalso checks ARIA
